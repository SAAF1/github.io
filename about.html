      <h4>Here’s some things in particular that pushed me to UX:
        <ul class="bulletlist">
          <li class="tpadding-thirty">I’m curious. How does a plane work (it’s complicated)? What impact does gang-affiliation have on prison life? Which cultural shifts are causing the waning interest in baseball as the national sport? What are the implications?</li>
          <li class="tpadding-thirty">I’m bursting with ideas. Can depth sensing cameras be used to create a real-time topographic map on a pin impression board the visually challenged can navigate with? Can re-organizing a photographers workflow save them time?</li>
          <li class="tpadding-thirty">I want my ideas to matter. The world is full of lost opportunities and experiences so a strong process and thorough user research is vital to executing meaningful designs that have an impact.<br><br></li>

      <h2 class="max-width bpadding-thirty">Hi. I'm Abraham<br></h2>
      <h4 class="max-width">I wanted to be a UX Designer before ever hearing the term “UX”. Maybe it’s because I’ve contracted terminal curiosity and the doctor said this is the only field that can cure me. More likely it’s because <strong>I’m a people’s person who is obsessed with technology, bursting with ideas and want to make make an impact.</strong></h4>
      <h2 class="max-width tpadding-sixty">INTEGRITY > DESIGN</h2>
      <h4 class="max-width">I have a background in psychology and yes, I know how I feel about that. I also earned a Bachelors in Talmudic Law and I value the lessons from my BTL above all else. To study Talmud, students divide into pairs and inevitably ended up in long, loud arguments about the Talmud’s true intent. Incredibly, the students revert to being close friends when they’re finished studying because the conflict is driven by a search for truth, not ego. Learning to set ego aside is crucial because institutions can teach one to be a good designer but can’t force one to be a decent human being.<br><br></h4>
      <div class="quote tpadding-thirty bpadding-thirty">“Learning to set ego aside is crucial because institutions can teach one to be a good designer but can’t force one to be a decent human being."</div>
       <h4 class="tpadding-thirty max-width">I’m far from perfect, but I’m better than I used to be. So if you see me make a design decision that’s questionable or act in a way that’s inconsistent with my personal quest for growth, tell me. I won’t get angry, I’ll thank you for it. Really.</h4>
       <h2 class="max-width tpadding-sixty">BABYLONIAN ARAMAIC</h2>
         <h4 class="max-width">I learned the significance an interaction can have from Talmud as well, this time by teaching it. By “teaching” I mean explaining to middle-schoolers and early high schoolers legal theory written in two foreign languages, one which died out nearly a thousand years ago (Babylonian Aramaic) in the original text. Instead of lecturing, I focus on guiding them to reach the conclusions on their own and demonstrating how I merely fill in the cracks of what they already know. I’m trying to do more than impart knowledge. I want to change their perceptions of their own abilities and <strong>leave them better off having met me. I design with the same goal and focus on creating interactions that enhance people's lives not interrupt them.</strong><br><br>To me, UX is the opportunity to wonder “why” as a career,  spend time answering my own question and then use that answer to help people. Life doesn’t get a whole lot better than that.<br><br></h4>

         <h3 class="line tpadding-sixty max-width">Bonus Section</h3>
         <h4 class="tpadding-thirty max-width">Even as a kid I loved to tinker and took things apart to “improve” them. Much to my parents dismay, I got my paws on computers,  a nerf blaster I modded to shoot over my house and a model plane which I promptly flew through a window. I learned how to take things apart to understand the core of an experience and that windows are expensive.<br><br>I was a lego maniac and built monolithic creations with whatever nuggets of engineering I could intuit with my middle school brain. I  tested my creations by standing on them, assuming if they broke from my weight, I didn’t want them anyway. I don’t recall any breaking. It’s amazing what one can do before discovering YouTube.<br><br>During my free time I read books like some people taste wine but I’m too much of a people’s person to endorse Terry Pratchett's “if you have enough book space I don’t want to talk to you” approach. Almost.  Eager to commit literary malpractice, I’ve been working on my novel The Hunter Bloodlines for ten years now and project to be working on it for many more. I’m attempting to limit it to the genres of fantasy, science-fiction, espionage and some children’s literature but no promises. </h4>
