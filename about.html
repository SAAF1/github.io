      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    </div>
    <h3 class= "wide-h2">I'm a big picture, small details kind of guy and that bleeds into every aspect of my design process. I love to question, dig deeper and dream boldly all the while remaining aware of design constraints and technical limitations. I use my background in psychology to understand users and their needs. I also spent 15 months in Bloc's Product Design course submerged in design. My superpower is being magnetically attracted to constructive criticism, both personal and professional. I love to talk to people, have my mind changed and hear about other people's experiences. Drop me a line, I want to hear from you! </h3>

          <h4 class="max-widt">I wanted to be a UX Designer before ever hearing the term “UX”. Maybe it’s because I’ve contracted terminal curiosity and the doctor said this is the only field that can cure me. More likely it’s because <strong>I’m a peoples person who is obsessed with technology, bursting with ideas and wants to make make an impact.</strong></h4>

          <h4 class="max-widt">I have a background in psychology and yes, I know how I feel about that. I also earned a Bachelors in Talmudic Law and I value the lessons from my BTL above all else. To study Talmud, students divide into pairs and inevitably ended up in long, loud arguments about the Talmud’s true intent. Incredibly, the students revert to being close friends when they’re finished studying because the conflict is driven by a search for truth, not ego. Learning to set ego aside is crucial because institutions can teach one to be a good designer but can’t force one to be a decent human being.</h4>

           <h4 class="tpadding-thirt max-widt">I’m far from perfect, but I’m better than I used to be. So if you see me make a design decision that’s questionable or act in a way that’s inconsistent with my personal quest for growth, tell me. I won’t get angry, I’ll thank you for it. Really.</h4>
           <h2 class="max-widt tpadding-sixty"><strong>BABYLONIAN ARAMAIC</strong></h2>
             <h4 class="max-widt">I learned the significance an interaction can have from Talmud as well, this time by teaching it. By “teaching” I mean explaining to middle-schoolers and early high schoolers legal theory written in two foreign languages, one which died out nearly a thousand years ago (Babylonian Aramaic) in the original text. Instead of lecturing, I focus on guiding them to reach the conclusions on their own and demonstrating how I merely fill in the cracks of what they already know. I’m trying to do more than impart knowledge. I want to change their perceptions of their own abilities and <strong>leave them better off having met me. I design with the same goal and focus on creating interactions that enhance people's lives not interrupt them.</strong><br><br>To me, UX is the opportunity to wonder “why” as a career,  spend time answering my own question and then use that answer to help people. Life doesn’t get a whole lot better than that.</h4>
