#My Portfolio

This portfolio is meant to showcase not only my skills in design but my ability to improve. Let's take the Photogration case study for example. Over time the design went from this:


<img style="max-width:600px;" alt="Photogration case study before" src=images/case_study_before.png>

To this:

<img style="max-width:600px;" alt="Photogration case study before" src=images/case_study_after.png>
Here's why the new version is better:

1) Cleaner grid structure. Because of coding complications the "Problem" and "Solution" weren't adhering to the common grid. I also was center aligning h1's and before I knew it I had four different grids. Hardly Ideal. Except for quotes when I break the grid intentionally, the new one has only two. Count 'em :)

2) Color. This was a big one. I initially tried to symbolize that a particular h1 was beginning a new step in the design process by setting it on a gold bar that ran edge to edge. This didn't work visually and even more importantly, it didn't work as a system. Readers were not "picking up what I was putting down" - it didn't clearly communicate my intended purpose and made the case study seem inconsistent when h1's that were not part of the process didn't have it.   

Here's another example of how things changed:

<img style="max-width:600px;" alt="About before" src=images/about_before.png>

To this:

<img style="max-width:600px;" alt="About before" src=images/about_after.png>

The main difference is in typography. Both used the same beautiful Playfair Display font matched with Lato for the body but the new version really shows it off. The vertical line of text adds some visual interest while being large enough to flaunt that fine detail Playfair is known for. The body headings like "I'm curious" have a lot more visual interest as well.

Considering how important typography is to UX Design, I feel it was time well spent. Essentially what I'm saying is I'm a capable designer now but check back soon because I'll be exponentially better. I level up through practice and conversations with people like you.
