    <h1 class="textcenter">USER RESEARCH</h1>
    <h4 class="lpadding">I surveyed photographers to learn about the friction points (time and frustrations) in their workflow. The results were mixed. I didn’t realize that besides for skill level and subject material varying wildly, the same user could fit many profiles at different times of the day. A professional photographer often takes on the characteristics of a hobbyist when relaxing at home.<br>In regards to existing workflow problems, complaints about import and render times were mixed with no clear pattern. A significant minority reported a multi-device workflow that changed depending on the level of processing they wanted to invest in a photo. This may be related to professionals who at times resemble hobbyists. A majority used social media to share photos, often in conjunction with other services.<br>Without a clear pattern to the survey responses, my next step was to get some context with in-depth user interviews.

      <h4>I studied Lightroom, Capture One and Google Photos because this solution needs to marry the ease of Google Photo’s direct upload with the multi-device support of Lightroom and the professional orientation of Capture One.</h4>

            <h4>Lightroom cloud has a huge customer base, best multi-device and strong cloud support, integration with Adobe CC</h4>
            <img src=images/thumbsdown.png>
            <h4>Unpopular subscription only, multi-device and sharing still needs work.  Lacking features of classic LR desktop</h4>

            <h4>Expensive, learning curve, no-multi device or cloud support, lacks organizational abilities of Lightroom</h4>

        <h1 class="textcenter">PERSONAS</h1>
        <h4>I noticed two themes in my research.  Hobbyists want an easy, mobile workflow that allows immediate  sharing. Unnecessary friction makes them leave that camera at home. Professionals have an expert knowledge of the camera and software but struggle to balance building a brand, interacting with clients, editing and shooting. Both want to spend less time on tedious tasks and focus on creativity.</h4>

        <h1 class="textcenter">USER TESTING</h1>
        <h4>Using Invision, I prototyped my inititial wireframes and submitted them to a design critique before starting user testing in earnest. I learned that my onboarding was broken. Users were being thrown into a fully populated dashboard without explanation and were completely overwhelmed with no idea of where to go.</h4>
        <h1>“Users were being thrown into a fully populated dashboard”</h1>
        <h4>I simplified the dashboard by removing anything unnecessary and prepared three tasks for users to complete.</h4>
        <ul class="bulletlist">
          <li><h4>Complete sign up</h4><li>
          <li><h4>Import photos</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Rate and filter photos</h4></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>I found that the ability to demo the software without signing up confused users more than it helped. The dashboard’s cognitive load was down but users still felt lost. They also didn’t like how the software redirected them instead of using direct links. I realized that innovative software is useless if it doesn’t nail existing core experiences.</h4>
