    <h4 class="fifty-five-width tpadding-sixty">I surveyed photographers to learn about the friction points (time and frustrations) in their workflow. The results were mixed. I didn’t realize that besides for skill level and subject material varying wildly, the same user could fit many profiles at different times of the day. A professional photographer often takes on the characteristics of a hobbyist when relaxing at home.<br>In regards to existing workflow problems, complaints about import and render times were mixed with no clear pattern. A significant minority reported a multi-device workflow that changed depending on the level of processing they wanted to invest in a photo. This may be related to professionals who at times resemble hobbyists. A majority used social media to share photos, often in conjunction with other services.<br>Without a clear pattern to the survey responses, my next step was to get some context with in-depth user interviews.

        <h4 class="max-width tpadding-sixty">I noticed two themes in my research.  Hobbyists want an easy, mobile workflow that allows immediate  sharing. Unnecessary friction makes them leave that camera at home. Professionals have an expert knowledge of the camera and software but struggle to balance building a brand, interacting with clients, editing and shooting. Both want to spend less time on tedious tasks and focus on creativity.</h4>

My goal was to minimize the number of steps required to reach the dashboard while gaining sufficient user information to remember where users left off. Since this was a reimagining of a whole system, I created an option that allows users to photograph the QR code on the sign up page and jump straight into the program. Their accounts would now be linked through their camera with no email address or passwords immediately necessary. I realized during testing that in my attempts to simplify and speed up the sign up process I actually complicated things.</h4>

        <h4 class="max-width">I found that the ability to demo the software without signing up confused users more than it helped. The dashboard’s cognitive load was down but users still felt lost.

    <h4><ul class="solidbullets max-width tpadding-sixty bpadding-thirty">
        <li>Users don't scan the whole screen</li>
        <li>Core experience is more important than innovative features</li>
        <li>Friction points can become so imbedded in workflow they aren’t considered problems </li>
        <li>Test early & test often. I should have built out the prototype after verifying main functions worked</li>
        <li>Budget time for recruiting test particpants. Photographers are very difficult to recruit.</li>
        <li>Important functions need a direct button</li>
        <li>Less can be more. The ability to demo Photogration without signing up just confused users. </li>
      </ul></h4>
      <p class="max-width tpadding-thirty bpadding-sixty">I would like to extend onboarding and do more user tests. I also noticed users were mildly confused between rating and filtering photos. Finally, I would add more features to qualify for an MVP.</p>

        <h1 class="textcenter tpadding-sixty bpadding-thirty">CONCLUSION</h1>
        <h3 class="max-width bpadding-sixty">Photogration was a lesson in both possibilities and pitfalls. It validated my suspicion that workflow improvements are the next big thing in the struggling DSLR industry but highlighted how hard it is to design for such a diverse user base. I learned to budget for the time participant recruitment took when dealing with a niche base. Most importantly I learned the importance of testing early and testing often.</h3>
